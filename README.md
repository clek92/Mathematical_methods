# Mathematical_methods
University assignment on mathematical methods for business analytics <br>
The goal of the project was to conduct an analysis about the loan applicants <br>
The focus is mostly given on the mathematical aspects of the analysis and there are some limitations about the amount of variables and the techniques <br>
The dataset used is the lender club dataset found in kaggle <br>
**Limitations**
1) No more than 10 variables in the first part 
2) No more than 5 variables in the second part (1 dependent and 4 independent) <br>

**Requirements** <br>
Part One 
1. Conduct PCA to explore the most important features (although PCA is not a feature selection technique) 
2. Choose the most important variables through PCA
3. Explore the descriptive statistics of each variable 
4. Remove outliers
5. Define the distributions of the variables
6. Fit the most appropriate distribution on each variable <br>

Part two
1. Choose the dependent and the independent variables in order to conduct predictions using logistic regression model 
2. Conduct correlation analysis (using statistical tests as well)
3. Evaluate the model deployed
